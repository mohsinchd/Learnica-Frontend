            It's important to make sure your course is engaging for your
            students with a well-structured, practical, and rewarding learning
            experience. The most successful instructors spend time planning
            their course content before they start recording to ensure their
            course helps students achieve clear goals.

                <Accordion.Body>
                  A Learnica course can consist of a combination of videos,
                  slides, text, quizzes, coding exercises, assignments, and
                  practice tests. You can also add additional resources to your
                  course, including: PDFs, links, audio files, etc. These
                  components are structured into sections and lectures (sections
                  are groups of lectures).

                <Accordion.Body>
                  The only length requirement for a course is that it must be at
                  least 30 minutes. Your course should be as long as it takes to
                  fully teach your topic and allow your students to achieve the
                  course goals. If you’re unsure, you can also take a look at
                  other courses in your category to get a sense for the average
                  course length of similar courses.

                <Accordion.Body>
                  Course creation time varies greatly depending on the length of
                  the course and an instructor's time commitment. Many of our
                  instructors complete their courses in 30-45 days.

                </Accordion.Header>
                <Accordion.Body>
                  Yes! Learnica students love to practice and apply what they
                  are learning. Practice activities can be anything that makes a
                  student apply their learning, not just quizzes or worksheets.
                  Udemy gives you tools to create quizzes, practice tests,
                  coding exercises, and assignments in your course.
